What is Torn Gainz?

Torn Gainz is a gym optimization and comparison tool for Torn City—a game where lifting weights involves spreadsheets, millions of dollars, and some truly unhinged decision-making.

The purpose is simple: help you make smarter choices about training.

Torn Gainz lets you track and compare gym gainz over time, estimate the real costs of different training approaches, and evaluate jump methods side-by-side. Whether you’re slow-rolling daily trains, timing big jumps, stacking perks, or experimenting with boosters, the app helps answer questions like: Is this actually worth it? and What am I paying per point of gain?

Instead of relying on gut feelings, half-remembered forum posts, or vibes from global chat, Torn Gainz gives you clear comparisons and long-term trends so you can decide how hard you want to min-max your character—or whether you’re already doing just fine.

It’s not about telling you the “right” way to play. It’s about showing you what your choices are really doing.

Privacy & Ethics

We treat privacy and ethical data use as core values.

Your data belongs to you. Torn Gainz is built to avoid unnecessary collection, avoid dark patterns, and avoid doing anything sneaky in the background. Any optional data sharing is opt-in, transparent, and used only to improve the app—not to profile players, monetize behavior, or interfere with gameplay.

No automation. No exploits. No funny business.

Just numbers, comparisons, and better-informed gainz.
